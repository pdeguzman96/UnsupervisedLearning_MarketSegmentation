# Udacity-Arvato-Unsupervised
Udacity DSND Project in conjunction with Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics

## Overview
The aim of this project was to apply ML unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. Prior to applying the machine learning methods, we also require to assess and clean the data in order to convert the data into a usable form. These identified segments can then be used for direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns.
